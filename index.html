  This site is a collection of my works of writing, some fiction and some non-fiction, covering
  a variety of themes centered around and exploring the Sikh worldview and ethos. My hope is 
  that you find these interesting, inspirational, educational and uplifting. This is meant for
  all people everywhere. If you are reading this, you are in the right place.
