title: About
---

I began writing this genre of fiction in 2015. Beginning with short stories, I added novella's
and eventually articles and essays. In fiction and non-fiction, I explore ides and concepts as
viewed from the lens of the Sikh worldview and ethos. With my writing, I hope to inspire,
educate and uplift.

Sikhi does not belong to just one small geographical region of the world. Rather, it belongs to
the entirety of humanity - every living soul on this (and other) planets.

Sikhs in the diaspora are on the world stage. As such, they are ideally situated to provide
the discourse that is required for the world to learn about this unique and wonderful way of
life that they follow, the way of the Warrior Saint.
